# Wave Software Development Challenge

_(obs: build instructions and main features found under Documentation section below)_

Applicants for the [Software
developer](https://wave.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/view.php?id=1) role at Wave must
complete the following challenge, and submit a solution prior to the onsite
interview.

The purpose of this exercise is to create something that we can work on
together during the onsite. We do this so that you get a chance to collaborate
with Wavers during the interview in a situation where you know something better
than us (it's your code, after all!)

There isn't a hard deadline for this exercise; take as long as you need to
complete it. However, in terms of total time spent actively working on the
challenge, we ask that you not spend more than a few hours, as we value your
time and are happy to leave things open to discussion in the on-site interview.

Please use whatever programming language and framework you feel the most
comfortable with.

Feel free to email [dev.careers@waveapps.com](dev.careers@waveapps.com) if you
have any questions.

## Project Description

Imagine that this is the early days of Wave's history, and that we are prototyping
a new payroll system with an early partner. Our partner is going to use our web
app to determine how much each employee should be paid in each _pay period_, so
it is critical that we get our numbers right.

The partner in question only pays its employees by the hour (there are no
salaried employees.) Employees belong to one of two _job groups_ which
determine their wages; job group A is paid $20/hr, and job group B is paid
$30/hr. Each employee is identified by a string called an "employee id" that is
globally unique in their system.

Hours are tracked per employee, per day in comma-separated value files (CSV).
Each individual CSV file is known as a "time report", and will contain:

1. A header, denoting the columns in the sheet (`date`, `hours worked`,
   `employee id`, `job group`)
1. 0 or more data rows
1. A footer row where the first cell contains the string `report id`, and the
   second cell contains a unique identifier for this report.

Our partner has guaranteed that:

1. Columns will always be in that order.
1. There will always be data in each column.
1. There will always be a well-formed header line.
1. There will always be a well-formed footer line.

An example input file named `sample.csv` is included in this repo.

### What your web-based application must do:

We've agreed to build the following web-based prototype for our partner.

1. Your app must accept (via a form) a comma separated file with the schema
   described in the previous section.
1. Your app must parse the given file, and store the timekeeping information in
   a relational database for archival reasons.
1. After upload, your application should display a _payroll report_. This
   report should also be accessible to the user without them having to upload a
   file first.
1. If an attempt is made to upload two files with the same report id, the
   second upload should fail with an error message indicating that this is not
   allowed.

The payroll report should be structured as follows:

1. There should be 3 columns in the report: `Employee Id`, `Pay Period`,
   `Amount Paid`
1. A `Pay Period` is a date interval that is roughly biweekly. Each month has
   two pay periods; the _first half_ is from the 1st to the 15th inclusive, and
   the _second half_ is from the 16th to the end of the month, inclusive.
1. Each employee should have a single row in the report for each pay period
   that they have recorded hours worked. The `Amount Paid` should be reported
   as the sum of the hours worked in that pay period multiplied by the hourly
   rate for their job group.
1. If an employee was not paid in a specific pay period, there should not be a
   row for that employee + pay period combination in the report.
1. The report should be sorted in some sensical order (e.g. sorted by employee
   id and then pay period start.)
1. The report should be based on all _of the data_ across _all of the uploaded
   time reports_, for all time.

As an example, a sample file with the following data:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>
    date
  </th>
  <th>
    hours worked
  </th>
  <th>
    employee id
  </th>
  <th>
    job group
  </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    4/11/2016
  </td>
  <td>
    10
  </td>
  <td>
    1
  </td>
  <td>
    A
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    14/11/2016
  </td>
  <td>
    5
  </td>
  <td>
    1
  </td>
  <td>
    A
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    20/11/2016
  </td>
  <td>
    3
  </td>
  <td>
    2
  </td>
  <td>
    B
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

should produce the following payroll report:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>
    Employee ID
  </th>
  <th>
    Pay Period
  </th>
  <th>
    Amount Paid
  </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    1
  </td>
  <td>
    1/11/2016 - 15/11/2016
  </td>
  <td>
    $300.00
  </td>
</tr>
  <td>
    2
  </td>
  <td>
    16/11/2016 - 30/11/2016
  </td>
  <td>
    $90.00
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Your application should be easy to set up, and should run on either Linux or
Mac OS X. It should not require any non open-source software.

There are many ways that this application could be built; we ask that you build
it in a way that showcases one of your strengths. If you enjoy front-end
development, do something interesting with the interface. If you like
object-oriented design, feel free to dive deeper into the domain model of this
problem. We're happy to tweak the requirements slightly if it helps you show
off one of your strengths.

### Documentation:

Please modify `README.md` to add:

1. Instructions on how to build/run your application
1. A paragraph or two about what you are particularly proud of in your
   implementation, and why.
   
## Build instructions

This project was built using the Java Spring Boot Framework. To run it, execute from the root folder:

``mvn spring-boot:run``

Or alternatively, build the project with:

``mvn clean install``

And execute it with: 

``java -jar target/payroll-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar``

The application starts a webserver on `localhost:8080`, where both options are available:
1. Upload a CSV file following the specified format, showing the current pay report after;
1. Get the current pay report, based on previous uploaded time reports on DB.

For simplicity, the application uses an in-memory H2 database, provided by Spring Boot.

## Main features

All input file entries are stored in DB, but would be redundant to recalculate historically during each upload of a new file,
which would certainly slow down the application as the number of records grow.  
The application was built to just increment the current _Amount Paid_ values (calculated on previous input uploads) 
per combination _employeeId+PayPeriod_, based on just the new entries received in the current CSV being processed.

For the pay report sorting (based on _EmployeeId_, followed by _Pay Period_), the implementation consists of:
- The _Model_ class for _PayReport_ extending _Comparable_ Interface;
- The method _compareTo_ is _overridden_ with the custom logic, to compare employeeId, and then compare the period if needed. 
- A call to `Collections.sort(List<PayReport>)` then sorts a given list following this customization.
